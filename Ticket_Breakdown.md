# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Your Breakdown Here
## Ticket 1: Create Report Data Query

**Description:**
This ticket involves creating a query that returns all Shifts worked by an Agent for a given quarter.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

The query should retrieve all Shifts for a given Agent based on their id and the specified quarter.
The query must include metadata about each Shift, including the Facility name and date and time of the Shift.
The query should sort the results by date and time in ascending order.
**Time/Effort Estimate: 4 hours**

**Implementation Details:**

Create a new file named getAgentShiftsQuery.js.
Write a SQL query that joins the Facilities, Agents and Shifts tables to retrieve all shift data for a given agent and quarter.
Add any necessary parameters to the query such as the agent ID and quarter start and end dates.
Test the query with sample data to ensure it returns the expected result.

## Ticket 2: Generate Report PDF Functionality

**Description:**
This ticket involves implementing a function that generates a PDF report from the list of Shifts retrieved in Ticket 1.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

The function should take a list of Shifts as input, along with any extra metadata required to generate the report.
The PDF generated by the function should include relevant metadata about each Shift, including the Facility name, date and time of the Shift, and the total number of hours worked by the Agent for that Shift.
The PDF should have a consistent format and layout across all reports generated.
**Time/Effort Estimate: 6 hours**

**Implementation Details:**

Create a new file named generateReportPDF.js.
Install a third-party package such as pdfmake to generate the PDF.
Write a function that takes the list of Shifts and other metadata as input, and structures the data to fit the pdfmake API format.
Use pdfmake to generate the PDF report based on the specified template and data.
Test the function with a sample input to ensure it generates the expected PDF report.

## Ticket 3: Integrate Report Data and PDF Generation
**Description:** 
This ticket involves integrating the query created in Ticket 1 and the function created in Ticket 2 to generate reports for a Facility.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

A new function named generateFacilityReport should be created that takes the Facility ID and quarter as input.
The function should retrieve all Shifts worked by Agents assigned to the Facility during the given quarter using the query from Ticket 1.
The function should call the generateReportPDF function from Ticket 2 and pass the retrieved Shifts to it.
The generated PDF report should be saved to the database or file system and its location returned by the function.
**Time/Effort Estimate: 8 hours**

**Implementation Details:**

Create a new file named generateFacilityReport.js.
Import the functions created in Tickets 1 and 2 into this file.
Write a function that takes the Facility ID and quarter as input, retrieves all Shifts for the Facility using the query from Ticket 1, and passes the Shifts to the generateReportPDF function from Ticket 2.
Determine where the generated PDF report should be saved (e.g. a new table in the database or a file system).
Update the generateFacilityReport function to save the PDF report and return its location.
Test the function with a sample input to ensure it generates the expected PDF report and saves it in the correct location.
